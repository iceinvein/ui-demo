# UI Component Showcase

My personal collection of interactive UI components featuring smooth animations, live previews, and syntax-highlighted code examples. This project demonstrates my approach to building beautiful, reusable components with modern web technologies.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Component Gallery** - Browse my components organized by categories
- **Live Previews** - See each component in action with real-time interactions
- **Code Viewer** - Syntax-highlighted code with one-click copy functionality
- **Multi-File Support** - View component implementations across multiple files
- **Smooth Animations** - Buttery-smooth transitions powered by Framer Motion
- **Responsive Design** - Beautiful on all screen sizes

## 🎯 About This Project

- A **portfolio piece** demonstrating my UI/UX development skills
- A **living library** of reusable components I've created
- An **interactive demo** of my work with modern React and animation techniques
- A **reference** for my component design patterns and code quality
